**Expose** is a *presentation component* Created by Dan storey.
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielstorey/assets/master/reveal-demo.png" alt="Expose in action">

The **Expose** component displays panels of content hidden behind front covers. When clicked the cover animates to expose the content below. A range of different animations are available as listed below. When clicked again the cover is restored.
