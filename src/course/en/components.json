These plans will be expected to include  consideration of the aspects identified in Box 4.B of Chapter 4 of this report. To support this recommendation, succinct guidance setting out the key, generic issues that drive effective quality assurance will be added to “Managing Public Money” – which offers guidance on how to handle public funds properly;",
